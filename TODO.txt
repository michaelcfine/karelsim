Karel To Do List
================

PORTING WORK
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- PORT BUILD FROM USE OF r.js, etc.
- WORLD IS ONE CELL BIG :(
- TEST THOROUGHLY


High Priority / Easy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- GET IT WORKING! FULLY TEST!
- print(add(1,2)-add(3,4)) gives 4, not -4 (two pops not ordered properly)
- For
- Switch


Medium Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Run/pause as one icon position instead of separate?
- Line number for function returns should be at end of function, not top
- Karel syntax

- Artificial step at end of variable declarations nxt value seems wrong (function main() { var a,b, c; a = 1;...})
- function log() {...} would cause problems with console.log() (likely)... would cause console . jsim._call('log') Need scoping
- Minimal vs. full command set (for each of JS and Original Karel syntax)
- Decide about requirement for main() vs. loose code (like real js)
- breakpoints
- Complete dependency management / edge cases: change/load world, can step after run for a while and paused
- Demo mode which includes design icons for editing world but NOT export import, clipboard for pgm, immediate window


Low Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performance (don't make ember rows and columns derived?)
- Mazebeeper program
- When adding quotes to string literals, need to escape any quote marks inside
- Name event handlers with naming convention
- Formalize sanity check stuff or remove???


V2
~~
- Slider for playback speed instead of +/-
- Drag and drop for size of pgm textarea


Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~
group(id, textkey, created_date, active_flag, numUsersAllowed, numUsersUsed
user(id, email, password, created_date, active_flag, group_id
world(id, user_id, description, definition, created_date, last_modified_date
program(id, user_id, name, version_number, description, code, created_date, last_modified_date

Pay:
- Create your own worlds that you can save and share within your class/group
- Save programs, including versioning
- List/print/run all user programs within group (teacher 'grading' classroom of assignments)
